          Remember the day we first met? It was raining, we were in the car,<br>
           and I was trying to play it cool while stealing glances at you. <br>
           The AC was blasting cold air, but I swear, my heart was racing like crazy! <br>
           I remember stealing glances into your eyes, <br>
           feeling a connection that touched me deeply.
        </p>

        <p>
          That day marked the beginning of something special for me. <br>
          Your presence brought me peace, and your smile brightened my world.<br>
           It felt like fate had brought us together in that moment. Thank You

          I'm shy to say "I love you," so I'm writing this to you instead. <br>
          I hope you understand. I miss you every day. <br>I want to hang out with you, go on trips, 
          <br>share meals, dance, and walk together. I want to experience love and achieve success with you. <br>
           I want to say it aloud, but I'm afraid. <br>Can you please help me overcome my insecurities with your love? 
           <br>Can we vibe and live together?  <br>I want to spend all my days and nights with you, no matter what. <br>
           Please try to understand, okay? Te amo <br>
           <h3>You were an unexpected surprise, the defining moment. The collision of stars that slammed into me hard and sent my neat little world plummeting into the ocean.

            I never expected it to be you, you know? But it's you. And now there's no looking back.
            
            Maybe it is your laugh, or your eyes, or smile. Maybe it is your hair, or your voice, or personality, or listening you talk?
            
            Whatever it is, I'm happy that it's with you!
            💕</h3>

          your absence leaves a void that only your presence can fill. <br>
           I ache to be near you, to feel your embrace and hear your voice. <br>
            You mean the world to me,  <br>
            and I long for the day we're together again
